## printf42_mandatorytester
Ugly Tester for 42 printf mandatory part. Does explicit NOT check for flags. Only types.

As said. Only checks mandatory types. I built this for myself and thought, why not share it.

I would recommend other testers too to check your project for errors as mine only handles types!

I liked [paulo santanas tester for ft_printf](https://github.com/paulo-santana/ft_printf_tester)
